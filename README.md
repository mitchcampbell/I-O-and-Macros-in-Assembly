# I-O-and-Macros-in-Assembly
Author: Mitch Campbell

## Description
This is my final project for CS271 Computer Architecture and Assembly (completed December 2020). It is intended to demonstrate working familiarity with Assembly: branching logic (e.g. jmp), prodecures, macros, low-level I/O and working with string primitives (e.g. lodsb, stosb).

## How it works
The program:
* reads input from the user
* validates that the input is a valid 32-bit signed integer
* converts the input from a string into an integer
* performs calculations (sum, rounded average)
* converts the calculated numbers to string and displays the string

Here is an example showing the program in action
